# Tip-Calculator
The app is created by inspiration from Rahul Pandey's "Tippy" and Google developers' "Tip Time" applications!
I've learnt a lot while creating this app such as night theme, chip widgets, bottom sheet dialog, supporting
multiple screen sizes by using constraintLayout specifically Guidlines, Supporting multiple locales etc.
## Features
The app takes three inputs and gives three outputs,
Inputs: 
- Total bill
- Split number
- Tip percentage
Outputs: 
- Total per person
- Bill (devided into split number)
- Tip amount
Additionally, the output values can be presented in rounded up.
All of these features are user-friendly and work smoothly, color pallete has choosen relaying on the most 
frequent colors in restuarants in order to create familiar visual effect
## Installation
The app is not yet available on the Google Play Store. You need to build the app yourself. You can do this 
by cloning the repository and building the app with Android Studio.
## Technologies
Tip Calculator app is written in Kotlin and used Android SDK
